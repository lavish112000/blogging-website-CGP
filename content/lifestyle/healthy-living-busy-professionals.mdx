You're crushing it at work, but your health is paying the price. The "Sitting Disease" is real: research shows that sitting for 10+ hours a day increases heart disease risk by 147%.

The good news? You don't need a 2-hour gym session or a personal chef. You need a system. This guide outlines a realistic, science-backed approach to wellness that fits into a 60-hour work week.

## 1. Movement: The "Snacking" Strategy

Stop thinking "exercise" and start thinking "movement." The goal is to break up sedentary time.

### Micro-Movements (NEAT)
Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) burns more calories than a 30-minute run.
*   **Walking Meetings:** Take calls while walking. You'll burn 200 calories/hour vs. 50 sitting.
*   **The Pomodoro Squat:** Every 25 minutes, do 10 squats or pushups.
*   **Stairs Rule:** If it's less than 3 floors, take the stairs. Always.

### The Minimum Effective Dose
You only need **20 minutes of high-intensity effort** to maintain cardiovascular health. Try a Tabata workout (20 seconds work, 10 seconds rest) before your morning shower.

## 2. Nutrition: The Sunday Power Hour

Decision fatigue leads to takeout. Solve this with the "Sunday Power Hour."

### The Batch Cooking Formula
Spend 60 minutes on Sunday prepping the basics:
1.  **3 Proteins:** Grilled chicken, hard-boiled eggs, baked salmon.
2.  **2 Carbs:** Quinoa, roasted sweet potatoes.
3.  **Unlimited Veggies:** Washed spinach, chopped peppers, roasted broccoli.

**The Rule:** Mix and match these during the week.
*   *Lunch:* Spinach + Chicken + Quinoa + Olive Oil.
*   *Snack:* Hard-boiled egg + Peppers.

### Hydration Hacks
Dehydration causes brain fog.
*   **Buy a 32oz Bottle:** Drink one before lunch, one after.
*   **Electrolytes:** Add a pinch of sea salt and lemon to your morning water for better absorption.

## 3. Sleep: The Non-Negotiable Performance Enhancer

Sleep is when your brain cleans itself. Less than 7 hours = cognitive impairment equivalent to being legally drunk.

### The 3-2-1 Rule
*   **3 Hours Before Bed:** No food (digestion disrupts deep sleep).
*   **2 Hours Before Bed:** No work (cortisol keeps you awake).
*   **1 Hour Before Bed:** No screens (blue light kills melatonin).

**Environment:** Keep your room cool (65°F/18°C) and pitch black.

## 4. Stress Management: Biohacking Your Nervous System

Chronic stress destroys your immune system. Use these tools to reset.

### Box Breathing (Navy SEAL Technique)
Use this before a high-stakes meeting:
1.  Inhale for 4 seconds.
2.  Hold for 4 seconds.
3.  Exhale for 4 seconds.
4.  Hold for 4 seconds.
*Repeat 4 times.* This physically forces your body into a calm state.

### The Email Curfew
Set a hard stop. No email after 8 PM. Your brain needs downtime to problem-solve subconsciously.

## 5. Ergonomics: Protect Your Body

If you must sit, do it right.
*   **Monitor:** Top of screen at eye level.
*   **Elbows:** 90-degree angle.
*   **20-20-20 Rule:** Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to prevent eye strain.

## Conclusion: The 60-Minute Miracle Morning

How you start the day dictates how you finish it. Try this 60-minute routine:
1.  **0-2 min:** Drink 16oz water.
2.  **2-22 min:** Movement (Jog, Yoga, HIIT).
3.  **22-35 min:** High-protein breakfast (30g protein).
4.  **35-45 min:** Meditation or Journaling.
5.  **45-60 min:** Deep Work (Top priority task).

Health isn't a cost; it's an investment. Start with one of these pillars today.
